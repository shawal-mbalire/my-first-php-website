# DISTRIBUTED INFORMATION SYSTEMS ASSIGNMENT

## Task Overview

Design and implement a distributed information system for a company of your choice. The system
should consist of three departments, each with a web page that contains appropriate headings,
paragraphs, multimedia and relevant forms hosted locally on separate computers. The data from
the forms should be submitted to a database hosted on another computer. Additionally, the web
pages should be able to retrieve data from the database.
To ensure security, the web pages should offer authentication. All computers should be on the
same local network; otherwise, the system should not work.
